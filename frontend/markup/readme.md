## Description
Your task is to create an HTML page describing the content shown in the two attached images. You don’t need to style the page with CSS or add any behaviour — we’re only curious to see how you would structure the page shown in the wireframes using semantic HTML. (In the same vein, don't worry about linking to real images or other content.)

While structuring the page, be sure to consider:

- What are the most meaningful HTML elements and attributes to use in order to describe the page to the widest range of people (sighted, people using a screen reader, people using other assistive technologies)?
- Does your markup accurately reflect the page outline shown below (or can you improve on it)?
- Bonus points if you can work in ARIA attributes or other descriptive aids

This task should take no more than 30 minutes. If you can't finish the task in that time, submit what you’ve got, and we can discuss the rest in person.
